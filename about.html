                    <h2>Personal Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Gabriel Abreu, and I’m a freshman at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I was born and raised in Springfield, New Jersey, where I’ve grown up surrounded by a supportive community and strong family values. Starting college has been a big step for me, and I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and building connections that will shape my future.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>
                        I’m currently majoring in Software and Data Engineering Technology, also known as SDET. I’ve always been interested in how technology works and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I’m looking forward to developing my skills in programming, data analysis, and system design, while also gaining hands-on experience that will prepare me for a career in the tech field.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Outside of class, I run my own 3D printing business, which I started earlier this year. I enjoy creating new designs, improving my technical skills, and turning ideas into real products. Along with that, I’m very involved in my local parish, where I serve on the pastoral council, help with family faith formation, and volunteer at all parish events. I also serve as an altar server, which has taught me the importance of responsibility, teamwork, and leadership within my community.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        My journey so far has been about learning to take initiative and make the most of new opportunities. From starting my own business to staying active in my parish, I’ve learned how to balance work, service, and academics. Transitioning into college has shown me the value of time management and persistence, and I’m excited to continue growing both personally and professionally during my time at NJIT.
