                    <h2>Personal Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Gabriel Abreu, a passionate student pursuing Software Development Engineering in Test (SDET). 
                        I've been programming for over a year now and enjoy diving into challenging problems and 
                        creating efficient solutions. My journey in software development began with a curiosity 
                        about how things work behind the scenes of the applications we use every day.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>
                        Currently enrolled in SDET 101 at NJIT, I'm building a strong foundation in software 
                        development and testing practices. Through coursework and hands-on projects, I'm gaining 
                        expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, as well as automated testing frameworks.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in software quality assurance and automation. 
                        I enjoy working on personal projects that challenge my problem-solving skills and allow 
                        me to experiment with new technologies. When I'm not coding, I like to stay updated with 
                        the latest trends in software development and testing methodologies.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        What started as learning basic programming concepts has evolved into a passion for 
                        software development engineering. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and 
                        ensuring software quality through comprehensive testing. Every project is an opportunity 
                        to learn something new and improve my skills.
